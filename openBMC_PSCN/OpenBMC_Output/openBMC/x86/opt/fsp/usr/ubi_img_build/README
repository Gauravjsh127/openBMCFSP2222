The crp_nor configuation is currently only experimental to figure out if the
concepts used for FSP-1 are applicable for FSP-0 based Titan/CRP cards using the
FSP-0 processor. Please to not look at them ;-).


For network boot, change or add the following boot parameters.  In case of
ipaddr, etc. you might want to pick different values.  This merely serves
as an example.

ipaddr=192.168.0.44
serverip=192.168.0.2
netboot=root=/dev/nfs ip=192.168.0.44:192.168.0.2::255.255.255.0:sunray:eth0:off nfsroot=192.168.0.2:/tftpboot/192.168.0.44
bootargs=console=ttyS0,57600 ethaddr=$(ethaddr) eth1addr=$(eth1addr) mem=$(mem) slram=tmp,$(tmp_addr),+$(tmp_size),pcs,$(mem),+$(pcs_size) $(netboot)
netcmd=tftp 0 vmlinux.bin; bootx $fileaddr
bootcmd=run setupcmd; run netcmd; reset

pdd has been moved into fsp-ibm-tools/tools/card_data
you will find a subdirectory for each cardtyp (nand and nor)
